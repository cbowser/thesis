    <p class="lh-copy measure bt pt3">
When an investigation into the Street View project was conducted, Google initially denied collecting any personal data. However, eventually they admitted to it. At first they said it was unintentional, but eventually admitted that it was a deliberate software design decision. They placed the blame on one lone engineer who was never identified. A section of the Federal Communications Commission's report is seen below:

  <p class="b ttu"> Introduction:</p>

    <ol class="lh-copy f6 pl4">
<li class="pb3">Between May 2007 and May 2010, as part of its Street View project, Google Inc. (Google or Company) collected data from Wi-Fi networks throughout the United States and around the world. The purpose of Google’s Wi-Fi data collection initiative was to capture information about Wi-Fi networks that the Company could use to help establish users’ locations and provide location-based services. <span class="highlights">But Google also collected “payload” data...that was not needed for its location database project. This payload data included e-mail and text messages, passwords, Internet usage history, and other highly sensitive personal information.</span></li>

<li class="lh-copy f6">
When European data protection authorities investigated Google’s Wi-Fi data collection efforts in 2010, the Company initially denied collecting payload data. On May 14, 2010, however, Google publicly acknowledged that it had been “collecting samples of payload data from open (i.e. non-password protected) WiFi networks” but stated that it likely collected only fragmented data. Google traced the collection of payload data to code that was “mistakenly” included in its Wi-Fi data collection software. <span class="highlights">On October 22, 2010, Google acknowledged for the first time that “in some instances entire emails and URLs were captured, as well as passwords.</span> And finally, as described below, the Company provided evidence to the Federal Communications Commission showing that <span class="highlights">the data collection resulted from a deliberate software-design decision by one of the Google employees working on the Street View project.</span>
